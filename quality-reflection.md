Structured Triangulation Approach

1.	Triple-Generate Method:
-	Run the same prompt three separate times
-	Save each output as a separate document
-	Compare the outputs to identify commonalities and divergences

2.	Cross-Validation Template: Add these instructions to your prompt:
After generating your initial response, I want you to:
1. Pause and critically review your work from the perspective of a different risk professional
2. Identify any assumptions you've made or areas where alternative interpretations are possible
3. Note any inconsistencies or gaps in your analysis
4. Provide a confidence rating (High/Medium/Low) for each section of your analysis
5. Highlight 3-5 areas where additional validation would strengthen the analysis
6. Provide a brief "Peer Review Summary" that highlights the strengths and potential weaknesses of your analysis

This self-review should appear at the end of your response under a "Peer Review and Validation" heading.

3.	Explicit Quality Criteria: Specify the exact criteria that matter most for consistency:
When analyzing the process and identifying risks, apply these specific quality criteria:
- Risk statements must follow the exact format: "Risk that [event] occurs due to [causes], resulting in [consequences]"
- Each control must be classified as Preventative, Detective, or Corrective (no other classifications)
- Rate each control on a scale of 1-5 for maturity, with clear criteria for each rating
- Use only the following risk categories: [list your preferred categories]
- When identifying gaps, use only these classifications: "No Gap", "Partial Gap", or "Complete Gap"

4.	Comparative Analysis Instruction: If you've already generated responses, you can ask for consistency checking:
I have previously generated analyses of this process. Review your current analysis and focus on maintaining consistency in:
1. The granularity of process steps (aim for 7-9 main steps)
2. The severity and likelihood assessment of risks
3. The depth of control analysis and gap identification
4. The specificity of recommended next steps

If you find yourself deviating substantially from my previous analyses, provide explicit reasoning for the difference.

5.	Expert Panel Simulation: Ask the model to simulate different expert perspectives:

After completing your analysis, perform a simulated expert panel review by adopting these three perspectives:
1. Risk Management Expert: Focus on comprehensive risk identification and assessment
2. Process Specialist: Evaluate the practical implementation of controls
3. Compliance Officer: Assess the analysis against CPS 230 requirements

Provide brief feedback from each perspective and reconcile any differences to create a more robust final output.
Implementation Tips
1.	Save Templates: Create a document with these triangulation approaches so you can consistently apply them
2.	Version Tracking: Keep track of which approach you used for each output to identify which works best
3.	Iteration: If the first output lacks consistency, try sending it back with specific feedback: "Your risk classification seems inconsistent between risks 3 and 7. Please review and standardize."
4.	Temperature Setting: If Copilot allows you to adjust "temperature" (randomness), use a lower setting (0.1-0.3) for more consistent outputs
5.	Explicit Structure: Provide even more rigid structure with numbered sections, tables, and specific word counts
