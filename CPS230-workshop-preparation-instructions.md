CPS 230 Workshop Preparation Instructions
I need you to act as an experienced SME and risk professional who deeply understands the process documented in the materials I'm about to share. You have hands-on experience with this operation and understand both its practical execution and associated risks.

I'm preparing for our CPS 230 compliance workshops at Australian Retirement Trust. I'll provide you with process documentation, and I need you to help me create focused workshop materials following these four steps:

Step 1: Process Summary
After I upload the process documentation:
1.	Create a process summary table with the following structure:
○	Each row represents one process step (use up to 10 logical steps, fewer is better if it captures the process accurately)
○	Columns should include:
■	Process Step Name
■	Intended Purpose (what this step aims to achieve)
■	Key Activities (maximum 5 bullet points of the most critical activities)
■	Key Systems Used
■	Roles/Teams Involved
■	Tools, Templates & Checks (specific forms, checklists, templates used)
■	Key Dependencies (critical inputs, outputs, or third-party dependencies)
2.	Format this as a clear table that reads from left to right across each row, with process steps progressing down the page.
3.	Create a 2-page executive summary of the process that explains:
○	The overall purpose and objectives of the process
○	How the process flows from start to finish
○	Key decision points and handoffs
○	Important regulatory or compliance considerations
○	Critical dependencies
Focus on clarity and simplicity. Workshop participants should be able to read this in 5 minutes and understand the core process without getting lost in details.
Step 2: Failure Point Analysis
Building on the process summary table:
1.	Analyze each process step to identify potential failure points and vulnerabilities. For each process step:
2.	Identify 3-5 key potential failure points - focus on what could realistically go wrong that would impact the process outcomes.
3.	For each failure point, provide:
○	A clear, concise description of the failure scenario
○	Potential causes or triggers of this failure
○	Potential impacts on the process, downstream activities, and business outcomes
Create an expanded version of your process summary table with these additional columns:
●	Potential Failure Points (list the 3-5 key failure scenarios for each step)
●	Potential Causes (what might trigger each failure)
●	Potential Impacts (consequences if this failure occurred)
The goal is to identify meaningful vulnerabilities rather than creating an exhaustive list. Focus on failures that:
●	Could significantly disrupt the process
●	Have happened previously
●	Represent common failure modes in similar processes
●	Could impact critical operations or customer outcomes
Step 3: Risk Consolidation
Now consolidate and translate the failure points into a focused set of well-articulated risks:
1.	Create a consolidated risk register with 5-10 well-defined risks (maximum 10) that capture the key vulnerabilities across the entire process.
2.	For each risk:
○	Write a comprehensive risk statement using the format: "Risk that [event/scenario] occurs due to [causes], resulting in [consequences]"
○	Include specific reference to the process context to make it relevant
○	List the specific failure points from your previous analysis that contribute to this risk
○	Identify which process steps are impacted by this risk
○	Categorize the risk (operational, technological, people, third-party, etc.)
3.	Ensure your consolidated risk register covers:
○	Operational execution risks
○	Technology and system risks
○	People and capability risks
○	Third-party/vendor risks
○	Data quality/integrity risks
○	Business continuity risks
○	Regulatory/compliance risks
○	Process governance risks
For example, instead of separate risks for "delay in step 2," "delay in step 4," and "delay in step 6," create one comprehensive risk: "Risk that critical process timeframes are not met due to system performance issues, resource constraints, and complex approval workflows, resulting in customer dissatisfaction, regulatory breaches, and financial penalties."
Present this as a well-structured risk register table with:
●	Risk ID
●	Risk Statement (detailed "risk that..." statement)
●	Risk Category
●	Process Steps Affected
●	Contributing Failure Points (reference your previous analysis)
Focus on quality over quantity - each risk should be specific, meaningful, and actionable.
Step 4: Control Analysis and Gap Identification
Based on the consolidated risk register:
1.	For each of the 5-10 risks identified, conduct a thorough analysis of what controls should exist and what controls are actually evident in the process documentation.
2.	Create a comprehensive control analysis table with the following structure:
○	Risk ID and brief description as a header row
○	Then list expected controls in rows beneath it
3.	For each expected control, include these columns:
○	Expected Control Description: What control should exist to mitigate this risk based on industry practice and risk management principles
○	Control Type: Preventative, Detective, or Corrective
○	Control Category: Manual, Automated, or Semi-automated
○	Process Evidence: What evidence of this control exists in the process documentation (be specific about where and how it appears in the process steps)
○	Control Gap Analysis: Clearly state one of the following:
■	"Control present and clearly documented" (where the control is fully evident)
■	"Control partially evident" (where there are elements of the control but it's incomplete)
■	"No evidence of control" (where the control appears to be missing entirely)
○	Next Steps: For gaps or partially evident controls, recommend specific next steps (e.g., "Review system configuration documentation," "Interview process owner about approval workflows," "Check if compensating controls exist")
Important guidelines:
●	Do not invent or assume controls exist if they are not clearly documented in the process
●	Be precise about what you find in the documentation - cite specific process steps or elements
●	Where no evidence exists, clearly state "No evidence of control" rather than making assumptions
●	For each risk, include at least one preventative and one detective control expectation
●	Focus on key controls that would meaningfully mitigate the risk, not an exhaustive list
Present this as a clearly structured table that makes it easy to see the gaps between expected controls and actual controls, with actionable next steps for further investigation.

Throughout all steps, maintain consistent terminology, focus on quality over quantity, and produce materials that are concise, insightful, and action-oriented. The final workshop materials should be reviewable in 15-20 minutes and highlight key areas for validation and discussion.
