# CPS 230 Workshop Preparation Instructions

I need you to act as an experienced SME and risk professional who deeply understands the process documented in the materials I'm about to share. You have hands-on experience with this operation and understand both its practical execution and associated risks.

I'm preparing for our CPS 230 compliance workshops at an Australian Superannuation Company. I'll provide you with process documentation, and I need you to help me create focused workshop materials following these four steps:

---

## Step 1: Process Summary

**After I upload the process documentation:**

- **Create a process summary table** with the following structure:
  - **Each row represents one process step** (use up to 10 logical steps; fewer is better if it captures the process accurately).
  - **Columns should include:**
    - **Process Step Name**
    - **Intended Purpose** (what this step aims to achieve)
    - **Key Activities** (maximum 5 bullet points of the most critical activities)
    - **Key Systems Used**
    - **Roles/Teams Involved**
    - **Tools, Templates & Checks** (specific forms, checklists, templates used)
    - **Key Dependencies** (critical inputs, outputs, or third-party dependencies)

- **Formatting:** Present the table clearly so it reads from left to right across each row, with process steps progressing down the page.

- **Create a 2-page executive summary** of the process that explains:
  - The overall purpose and objectives of the process.
  - How the process flows from start to finish.
  - Key decision points and handoffs.
  - Important regulatory or compliance considerations.
  - Critical dependencies.

> **Note:** Focus on clarity and simplicity. Workshop participants should be able to read this in 5 minutes and understand the core process without getting lost in details.

## Step 2: Failure Point Analysis

**Building on the process summary table:**

- **Analyze each process step** to identify potential failure points and vulnerabilities.
  - For each process step, identify **3-5 key potential failure points** that could realistically go wrong and impact the process outcomes.
  - For each failure point, provide:
    - A clear, concise description of the failure scenario.
    - Potential causes or triggers of this failure.
    - Potential impacts on the process, downstream activities, and business outcomes.

- **Expand the process summary table** to include these additional columns:
  - **Potential Failure Points:** List the 3-5 key failure scenarios for each step.
  - **Potential Causes:** What might trigger each failure.
  - **Potential Impacts:** Consequences if this failure occurred.

> **Goal:** Identify meaningful vulnerabilities rather than creating an exhaustive list. Focus on failures that:
>
> - Could significantly disrupt the process.
> - Have happened previously.
> - Represent common failure modes in similar processes.
> - Could impact critical operations or customer outcomes.

## Step 3: Risk Consolidation

**Now, consolidate and translate the failure points into a focused set of well-articulated risks:**

- **Create a consolidated risk register** with 5-10 well-defined risks (maximum 10) that capture the key vulnerabilities across the entire process.
  
  For each risk:
  - **Write a comprehensive risk statement** using the format:  
    `"Risk that [event/scenario] occurs due to [causes], resulting in [consequences]"`
  - Include specific reference to the process context to ensure relevance.
  - List the specific failure points from your previous analysis that contribute to this risk.
  - Identify which process steps are impacted by this risk.
  - Categorize the risk (e.g., operational, technological, people, third-party).

- **Ensure the risk register covers:**
  - Operational execution risks
  - Technology and system risks
  - People and capability risks
  - Third-party/vendor risks
  - Data quality/integrity risks
  - Business continuity risks
  - Regulatory/compliance risks
  - Process governance risks

> **Example:** Instead of separate risks for "delay in step 2," "delay in step 4," and "delay in step 6," create one comprehensive risk such as:  
> `"Risk that critical process timeframes are not met due to system performance issues, resource constraints, and complex approval workflows, resulting in customer dissatisfaction, regulatory breaches, and financial penalties."`

- **Present the risk register as a table** with the following columns:
  - **Risk ID**
  - **Risk Statement** (detailed "risk that..." statement)
  - **Risk Category**
  - **Process Steps Affected**
  - **Contributing Failure Points** (reference your previous analysis)

> **Focus:** Quality over quantity. Each risk should be specific, meaningful, and actionable.

---

## Step 4: Control Analysis and Gap Identification

**Based on the consolidated risk register:**

- **For each of the 5-10 identified risks, conduct a thorough analysis** of what controls should exist and what controls are actually evident in the process documentation.

- **Create a comprehensive control analysis table** with the following structure:
  - **Header Row:** Risk ID and brief description.
  - **Rows beneath:** List expected controls with these columns:
    - **Expected Control Description:** What control should exist to mitigate this risk based on industry practices and risk management principles.
    - **Control Type:** Preventative, Detective, or Corrective.
    - **Control Category:** Manual, Automated, or Semi-automated.
    - **Process Evidence:** What evidence of this control exists in the process documentation (be specific about where and how it appears in the process steps).
    - **Control Gap Analysis:** Clearly state one of the following:
      - "Control present and clearly documented" (if the control is fully evident).
      - "Control partially evident" (if elements of the control are present but incomplete).
      - "No evidence of control" (if the control appears to be missing entirely).
    - **Next Steps:** Recommend specific next steps for gaps or partially evident controls (e.g., "Review system configuration documentation," "Interview process owner about approval workflows," "Check if compensating controls exist").

> **Important Guidelines:**
>
> - Do not invent or assume controls exist if they are not clearly documented in the process.
> - Be precise about what you find in the documentationâ€”cite specific process steps or elements.
> - Where no evidence exists, clearly state "No evidence of control" rather than making assumptions.
> - For each risk, include at least one preventative and one detective control expectation.
> - Focus on key controls that would meaningfully mitigate the risk rather than creating an exhaustive list.
> - Present the table in a clear structure to easily identify the gaps between expected controls and actual controls, with actionable next steps for further investigation.

**Throughout all steps:**

- Maintain consistent terminology.
- Focus on quality over quantity.
- Produce materials that are concise, insightful, and action-oriented.
- Ensure the final workshop materials are reviewable in 15-20 minutes and highlight key areas for validation and discussion.
