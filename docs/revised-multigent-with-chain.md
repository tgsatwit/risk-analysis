CPS 230 Risk Assessment Copilot Agent Chaining Implementation Guide

This guide outlines how to deploy the six-agent Microsoft Copilot Studio system for CPS 230 operational risk assessments. It incorporates detailed chaining instructions so multiple users can work on up to 100 business processes in parallel with consistency, precision, and traceability. Each agent (Process Summary, Process Detail Table, Failure Point Analysis, Risk Consolidation, Expected Controls, Control Gap Analysis) has a clearly defined role, and this plan ensures their outputs are properly linked and documented.

1. File Naming and SharePoint Folder Structure

To maintain organization across many processes, establish a standard SharePoint folder structure and file naming convention:
	•	SharePoint Site Structure: Create a dedicated site or document library (e.g., “CPS230_RiskAssessments”). Within it, have two main sections: one for Global References and one for Process-Specific Files.
	•	Global References Folder (/CPS230_Global/): Stores enterprise-wide reference documents such as the Risk Taxonomy, ORMF (Operational Risk Management Framework), and CPS 230 Guidelines. For example, save files like Risk_Taxonomy.pdf, ORMF.docx, CPS230_Guidelines.pdf in this folder. These remain accessible to all agents as read-only context.
	•	Processes Folder: Create a subfolder for each business process under assessment. Use a clear naming convention combining a unique ID and the process name. Example: /Processes/P123 CustomerOnboarding/ (where “P123” is an internal process ID and “CustomerOnboarding” is a concise process name).
	•	Subfolders or Single Folder per Process: Depending on team preference, you may either keep all step outputs in the process’s root folder or organize them into subfolders by step. Given the robust file naming (detailed below), a single folder per process is sufficient. However, if desired, subfolders can be created (e.g., /P123 CustomerOnboarding/Step1_Summary/, /Step2_Details/, etc.) to further segregate outputs.
	•	File Naming Conventions: All output files from the Copilot agents should follow a consistent naming scheme that identifies the process, step, and content. Use the format:
<ProcessID>_<ProcessName>_Step<Number>_<ContentDescription>.docx.
For example:
	•	P123_CustomerOnboarding_Step1_ProcessSummary.docx – output of Agent 1 (Process Summary).
	•	P123_CustomerOnboarding_Step2_ProcessDetail.docx – output of Agent 2 (Process Detail Table).
	•	P123_CustomerOnboarding_Step3_FailurePoints.docx – output of Agent 3 (Failure Point Analysis).
	•	P123_CustomerOnboarding_Step4_RiskConsolidation.docx – output of Agent 4 (Risk Consolidation risk register).
	•	P123_CustomerOnboarding_Step5_ExpectedControls.docx – output of Agent 5 (Expected Controls list).
	•	P123_CustomerOnboarding_Step6_ControlGapAnalysis.docx – output of Agent 6 (Control Gap Analysis).
The <ContentDescription> should be a brief tag for that step’s content. Use the same terms across all processes for uniformity (e.g., always “ProcessSummary” for step 1, “ProcessDetail” for step 2, etc. as shown above).
	•	Global Document Naming: Name enterprise reference files clearly and store in /CPS230_Global/. For example:
	•	CPS230_Risk_Taxonomy.docx (or .pdf) for the risk taxonomy document.
	•	Operational_Risk_Management_Framework.docx for the ORMF.
	•	CPS230_Regulatory_Guidelines.pdf for the official CPS 230 guidelines.
These files should not have process-specific prefixes since they apply to all processes. Ensure they are easy to identify and are the latest approved versions to avoid confusion.

This standardized folder and naming structure will allow team members to quickly find documents for any process and step, and it supports parallel work by preventing misplacement or overwriting of files.

2. Output Documentation Standards

Each Copilot agent will produce output that is polished and ready for business use. Adhere to these documentation standards for formatting and consistency across all Word outputs:
	•	Microsoft Word Document Outputs: All agent results should be captured in Word (.docx) format. Avoid markdown or plain text formatting in the final deliverables – instead, use Word’s rich text features (headings, tables, bold/italics, etc.) so that the documents are immediately usable in workshops or audits without further conversion.
	•	Section Headings: Use a consistent hierarchy and style for headings in every document:
	•	Apply Heading 2 style for primary section titles (since the process name or document title may be Heading 1 at the very top if needed). For example, in the Process Summary document, sections like “Process Overview” or “Key Objectives” would be formatted as Heading 2. In the Failure Points Analysis document, a section like “Failure Point Analysis by Step” would be Heading 2, and so on.
	•	If sub-sections are needed within a major section, use Heading 3 style for those sub-headings. Keep the structure consistent so that if one agent document uses sub-headings, others follow a similar pattern where applicable.
	•	Use a clear and descriptive title at the top of each document (could be the file name or a friendly title). For instance, the top of P123_CustomerOnboarding_Step3_FailurePoints.docx might read: “Process P123 – Customer Onboarding: Step 3 – Failure Point Analysis” as a Heading 1.
	•	Body Text and Font: Use a standard font and size for all narrative text to maintain a professional look:
	•	Font: Calibri (or the organization’s standard font) for all body text and table content.
	•	Size: 11 pt for body text (including table contents and bullet lists). This is a common default for readability.
	•	Ensure alignment and spacing are consistent (e.g., left-aligned paragraphs, and maybe 1.15 line spacing or as per company style guide).
	•	Tables Formatting: Many outputs (steps 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) will be primarily in table form. Follow these standards:
	•	Create actual tables in Word (cells, rows, columns) for structured data, not ASCII or markdown tables. Each column should have a heading, and data should be in their respective cells. This preserves formatting when the document is saved or printed.
	•	Column Headers: Bold them for clarity. For example, in the Process Detail table (step 2) the headers “Process Step Name, Intended Purpose, Key Activities, Key Systems, Roles, Tools, Dependencies” should all be in bold text. Similarly, in the Failure Points table, headers like “Potential Failure Points, Causes, Impacts” are bold.
	•	Consistency Across Tables: Use the same column naming and order that was defined in the methodology. Every process should use identical table structures for the same step. This makes it easy to compare processes or later aggregate information.
	•	Apply minimal table style (e.g., plain grid with visible cell borders or subtle lines). This helps the facilitators read and update the tables. If possible, use a simple Word table style template that can be applied uniformly.
	•	Narrative Sections: Some agents (e.g., Process Summary, Risk Consolidation) produce narrative text in addition to or instead of tables:
	•	Structure narratives in short paragraphs or bullet points as specified. For instance, the executive summary (from step 1) should be in well-spaced paragraphs under appropriate headings like “Purpose of the Process”, “Flow Overview”, etc.
	•	Use bullet points or numbered lists for enumerations. For example, if listing “Key decision points” in the executive summary, use a bullet list for clarity.
	•	Ensure these follow the same font and size standards.
	•	Document Evolution and Versioning: The risk assessment document is iterative – it evolves with each step. Rather than one static file that gets overwritten, maintain version history by using “Save As” after each step to create a new file (per the naming convention above). This means:
	•	After Agent 1 generates the Process Summary, the user saves it as ..._Step1_ProcessSummary.docx (Version 1 of the document).
	•	When Agent 2’s output (Process Detail Table) is ready, the user may choose to integrate it with the summary (e.g. adding the table into the same document after the narrative) or keep it separate. In either case, save a new file for step 2. This could be ..._Step2_ProcessDetail.docx (Version 2). The Step1 content can be carried over to this file so it now contains both the summary and detail table. The original Step1 file is preserved for lineage.
	•	Continue this pattern through to Step 6. Each subsequent file builds on the previous content (where practical) and gets a new step number (and implicitly a new version).
By the final step, you will have a series of files from _Step1_... through _Step6_... that show the progression. Traceability is ensured because one can compare these versions to see what was added at each stage.
	•	Uniform Style Guide: All agents are instructed to use the above formatting rules. This means the tone and format of writing remains uniform even though different agents (with different roles) generate the content. For example, the use of present tense, professional tone, or specific wording for control gaps (like “No evidence of control”) should remain consistent as defined in the methodology.

Adhering to these standards means each document produced is immediately workshop-ready and requires minimal editing. It also ensures that when multiple team members compile a final report or review each other’s work, everything looks cohesive.

3. Updated System Prompts for Agents

To enforce the above standards and smooth chaining, each Copilot Studio agent’s system prompt (the hidden instructions guiding the AI) must be updated. The prompt should clearly instruct the agent on output format, file references, and next steps. Key additions to each agent’s system prompt include:
	•	Structured Word-Format Output: Instruct the agent to format responses as if drafting a polished Word document. For example: “Present the output as a formal Word document with appropriate headings, normal text in Calibri 11pt, and use tables for structured data instead of lists or markdown.” This ensures the AI will not use markdown syntax (e.g., no | or --- for tables, and no ## for headings). Instead, it will output plain text that the user can directly paste into Word (or that Copilot can insert into a Word doc) with minimal reformatting needed.
	•	Section and Table Structure Guidance: The prompt should remind the agent of the expected structure. For instance, the Agent 2 prompt might say: “Create a table with columns: Process Step Name, Intended Purpose, Key Activities, etc., and ensure the table is formatted with bold headers.” Agent 4’s prompt might include: “Output a risk register table with columns for Risk ID, Risk Statement, Category, etc., in Word table format.” By baking these format instructions into the prompt, each agent knows the exact layout to produce.
	•	Output Save Location Note: At the end of the agent’s response, have the AI include a brief note indicating the file name and SharePoint folder where the user should save the output. This acts as a cue for the user to perform the save action correctly. For example, Agent 3 (Failure Point Analysis) should end its output with a line such as:
“Note: Save this document as P123_CustomerOnboarding_Step3_FailurePoints.docx in the Processes/P123 CustomerOnboarding/ SharePoint folder.”
This note should be clearly distinguishable (perhaps italicized or as a minor footer) and not part of the main content. All agents will follow this convention, merely changing the file name according to the process ID and step.
	•	Reference to Next Step’s Input: In the final lines of the output (or in the system prompt instructions to be reflected in output), each agent should guide the user on what the next agent will need. This creates a logical hand-off. For example:
	•	Agent 1 (Process Summary) might add: “Next, provide this summary and the original process document to Agent 2 (Process Detail Table) for detailed step mapping.”
	•	Agent 2 (Process Detail Table) could note: “Agent 3 will require the failure points to be identified using the table above. Ensure you have this Step2_ProcessDetail document ready for input into Agent 3.”
	•	Agent 3 might say: “Use the saved Failure Points document as input to Agent 4 – Risk Consolidation.”
	•	And so on, up to Agent 6.
By explicitly stating what the next agent expects (including exact file name and even section names), we reduce any ambiguity for the user on how to proceed. For instance, Agent 4’s system prompt can include: “Expecting input: the consolidated failure points table from Step 3 (document P123_..._Step3_FailurePoints.docx) to generate the risk register.” The agent can even list: “Please provide the Step 3 output file as input to proceed.” in its user prompt if needed.
	•	Maintain IDs and References: In the prompts for agents that introduce identifiers (like risk IDs or control IDs), instruct the AI to retain and reuse those IDs in subsequent outputs. For example, Agent 4’s prompt should include: “Assign a unique ID to each risk (e.g., R1, R2, …), and use these IDs when referencing risks later (e.g., in controls analysis).” Similarly, Agent 5 (Expected Controls) should be told: “Label each control entry in relation to the risk ID (e.g., R1-C1 for the first control for Risk R1) so that Agent 6 can reference these.” Even if the user does not provide the previous IDs explicitly (since the previous document will have them), the AI maintaining consistency through its instructions is crucial. This will ensure traceability (each control ties back to a risk, each risk ties back to failure points, etc.).

By updating each agent’s system prompt with these instructions, we effectively program the workflow into the AI. This reduces reliance on users to remember formatting or chaining details – the agents themselves will remind and enforce the protocol at each step. It also helps new team members onboarding to the process, as the agents will guide them through the required steps and document handling.

4. User Step-by-Step Checklist After Each Step

After each agent produces its output, users should perform a standard set of actions before moving on. This ensures that the work is correctly saved, formatted, and ready for the next link in the chain. The following checklist should be followed at the completion of each step (1 through 6):
	1.	Save the Output Document: Immediately save the agent’s output to the designated SharePoint folder with the correct file name. Use the name provided by the agent’s note (for example, “P123_CustomerOnboarding_Step4_RiskConsolidation.docx”). Double-check you are saving in the correct process folder (and subfolder if applicable). This preserves the work and creates the version trail.
	2.	Verify Formatting: Open the saved Word document and quickly review the formatting. Ensure all section headings, fonts, and table structures appear as intended:
	•	Confirm that headings are in the right style (e.g., Heading 2) and not plain text that just looks large or bold.
	•	Check that tables are rendering properly (no misaligned columns or markdown artifacts like | characters). All column headers should be bold and the text legible.
	•	If any formatting issues are present (for example, an entire table came out as a single paragraph), fix them now or note them for adjustment, so the next steps have clean input.
	3.	Review Content for Completeness and Accuracy: Read through the content to ensure the agent didn’t miss any critical points from the input or add any irrelevant information:
	•	For a summary or table, ensure each process step is captured and descriptions make sense.
	•	For failure analysis, verify that 3-5 realistic failure points per step are listed and they align with the step’s activities.
	•	For risk consolidation, check that all major failure themes are covered by the defined risks and that the risk statements follow the format.
	•	For controls, ensure each listed “expected control” is plausible for the given risk and that the documented evidence (or lack thereof) matches the earlier process details.
	•	If something appears incomplete or incorrect, you might circle back with that agent (by refining the prompt or adding clarifications) before proceeding, to avoid compounding errors. This manual content QA step is critical in a regulated environment to maintain quality.
	4.	Prepare Input for the Next Agent: Take the saved document and have it ready to feed into the next agent. In Copilot Studio, this could mean uploading the .docx as part of the next agent’s prompt, or copying the relevant sections into the chat for the next agent to analyze. Follow the guidance the previous agent provided about what is needed:
	•	If the next agent only needs a specific section (e.g., just the failure points table from the document), you might copy that section text.
	•	If it needs the whole document for context, ensure the entire .docx is accessible to the next agent (via the Studio’s file upload or share feature).
	•	For example, after saving the Failure Points Analysis (Step 3) document, you would provide that file to Agent 4 by attaching it or confirming to the agent that the file named ...Step3_FailurePoints.docx is the source to use.
	5.	Mark the Step as Complete (Metadata/Tracking): In SharePoint or your tracking system, update any indicators that this step is done. For instance, if using SharePoint metadata, you might have a column “Step 3 Status” where you set “Completed” with today’s date. Or, in an external tracker spreadsheet, mark the step as finished. This helps the team see progress at a glance and signals that the process is ready for the next step (especially important when steps might be done by different team members).
	6.	Follow Any Additional Team Protocols: Some organizations might require an independent review or approval at each stage (especially for risk and control identification under CPS 230 governance). If so, ensure you obtain that sign-off before moving to the next step. This could be a simple comment or approval in SharePoint or an email confirmation, as per your Operational Risk Management Framework.

Each agent’s output should ideally come with a reminder of these tasks (for example, the agent’s note might prompt saving and next input). Nonetheless, this checklist serves as a comprehensive user guide so nothing is overlooked between steps. By diligently following these actions, users maintain the integrity of the chain and reduce the chance of errors or lost information as multiple processes and people progress in parallel.

5. Linkage Between Steps and Maintaining Context

Strong linkage between steps is essential for traceability. Each agent’s work builds on the previous, so the hand-off must be exact. Here’s how to ensure seamless context transfer:
	•	Explicit File References in Prompts: As mentioned, each agent will expect a specific input from the prior step. The system design should reflect this clearly. For example, Agent 3 (Failure Point Analysis) knows it needs the detailed process steps from Agent 2. Its prompt (and the preceding agent’s output note) will explicitly say: “Input required: P123_CustomerOnboarding_Step2_ProcessDetail.docx (Process Detail Table), Section: ‘Process Steps Table’.” This way, when a user activates Agent 3, they know exactly which file (and even which part of it) to provide. There is no guesswork about which version or document to use.
	•	Section-Level Guidance: If a document contains multiple sections (e.g., the combined document for Steps 1 and 2 might have an executive summary section and a process table section), the agent should indicate which part it needs to focus on. For instance, Agent 4 might say it needs the “Potential Failure Points columns from the Step 3 output”. The user can then ensure they pass the relevant portion (or simply the whole file if the agent is capable of finding the section by heading). This prevents scenarios where the AI might consider unrelated text.
	•	Carry Forward Identifiers and Terminology: Maintain consistent naming of items across steps:
	•	Process Steps: If the process detail table (Step 2) labels steps as “Step 1: [Step Name]”, “Step 2: [Step Name]”, ensure that when failure points (Step 3) refer to those steps, they use the same labels or names. The failure analysis might be structured by step, so it should mirror the step names exactly as in Step 2. This linkage allows anyone reading the documents to connect a failure point back to the exact process step.
	•	Risk IDs: When Agent 4 consolidates risks, it will generate Risk IDs (e.g., R1, R2, … or perhaps a compound like P123-R1 to remain unique across processes). These IDs should appear in the Risk Register table. In Agent 5’s output (Expected Controls), each control should reference the risk ID it mitigates. For example, controls for Risk R1 should be listed under a subsection or table labeled “R1”, or have an adjacent column indicating “Risk ID: R1”. Agent 6 (Control Gap Analysis) then uses those same IDs when discussing gaps (e.g., “For Risk R1, Control R1-C2 is missing”). Consistency here means you can trace any control or gap back to the risk and original process issue it relates to.
	•	Control IDs: If numerous controls are expected, consider assigning control identifiers too. A simple scheme is by using the risk ID as a prefix (as noted above). For instance, the second control for Risk R1 could be “R1-C2”. These control IDs can be included in the Expected Controls table and then referenced in the Gap Analysis. Even if control IDs are not explicitly asked for, including them can help avoid confusion when discussing multiple controls under one risk.
	•	Documenting the Links in Output: Each document should include a brief introductory note or section that states its context. For example, the top of the Risk Consolidation file might include a sentence like: “This risk register was developed based on the failure points identified in document P123…Step3_FailurePoints.docx.” Similarly, the Control Gap Analysis intro can state: “This analysis evaluates the controls expected (from document Step5_ExpectedControls.docx) against evidence in the process.” This kind of cross-reference in the content itself reinforces the chain for any reader or auditor of the documents later.
	•	Avoiding Information Loss: Ensure that any critical information from a previous step is not overlooked in the next:
	•	If a failure point doesn’t clearly map to a risk in consolidation, the team should decide whether to adjust the risk statements or accept that some failure points were out of scope. But no failure identified should be completely lost; the consolidation agent prompt might be instructed to list which failure points tie to each risk, thereby capturing all.
	•	If a risk from the register somehow doesn’t have any expected controls listed, Agent 5 should flag that (it could indicate a gap in thinking or that the risk might be out of scope). The chain of prompts can include safety checks, like instructing Agent 5: “There should be at least one expected control per risk; if none, note this as a gap.”
	•	Testing the Chain: Before full deployment, test the entire linkage on a sample process:
	•	Provide a sample process document, run it through Agents 1–6 in sequence, and confirm that each hand-off works using the file names and content references as designed.
	•	This dry run will reveal if any agent is expecting information not provided or if any formatting inconsistencies cause confusion (for example, if Agent 4 can’t parse the table from Agent 3 due to a formatting issue).
	•	Adjust prompts or instructions accordingly. For instance, you might find Agent 3 should output the failure points in a separate table per step rather than one big table, to make it easier for Agent 4 to consume. These tweaks will strengthen the linkages.

By designing the agents to explicitly reference each other’s outputs and by rigorously maintaining naming/ID conventions, the system ensures end-to-end traceability. Anyone can pick up the final Control Gap Analysis and trace every gap back to a control, to a risk, to a failure point, and ultimately to the original process step in question by following the chain of IDs and document references.

6. Best Practices for Scaling and Team Coordination

When deploying this multi-step process across up to 100 business processes simultaneously, establishing team-wide best practices is crucial. These practices help maintain order, avoid duplicated effort, and create an audit trail for CPS 230 compliance. Below are recommendations for effective scaling:
	•	Central Tracker for Process Status: Use a SharePoint list, an Excel spreadsheet on SharePoint, or another project management tool as a master tracker. List each process (by ID and name) as a row, and include columns for each step (1 through 6) indicating status:
	•	Columns could be “Step 1 Complete?”, “Step 2 Complete?”, … “Finalized?” or a single “Current Stage” column that notes the last completed step.
	•	Team members should update the tracker immediately after finishing each step’s checklist. For instance, mark Step 3 as “Done” for Process P123 once the Failure Point Analysis doc is saved and reviewed. They might also include who completed it and the date.
	•	This tracker gives at-a-glance insight into progress across all processes. It prevents a scenario where, say, two users accidentally both start working on the same process’s next step, or where a process gets stalled because everyone assumed someone else was handling it.
	•	The tracker can also serve as an audit log for management to see how far along the organization is in completing all CPS 230 assessments.
	•	Parallel Work and Work Allocation: Clearly assign ownership of processes or steps to team members:
	•	One model is process-based ownership, where each process is assigned to a primary owner who shepherds it through all steps (possibly with others assisting or reviewing). In this model, that owner would be responsible for ensuring each step’s completion (even if they delegate running a particular agent to someone else).
	•	Another model is stage-based specialization, where, for example, a subset of the team focuses on running all Process Summary (Step 1) for every process, another team does all Failure Analyses (Step 3), etc. If using this model, the hand-offs need to be very clear. The tracker is essential here to know when a process is ready to move from one team to the next.
	•	Whichever model, make it explicit. Possibly note in the tracker who is assigned to each step for each process, or use SharePoint’s built-in assignment or task features if available.
	•	Consistent Version Control Practices: As discussed, saving separate files for each step inherently provides versioning. However, to further avoid confusion when multiple people are collaborating:
	•	Establish a convention for version numbering in file names if documents are revised beyond the standard chain. For example, if after completing Step 2, a revision was needed to the Process Detail table, you might save an updated file like P123_CustomerOnboarding_Step2_ProcessDetail_v2.docx (using a suffix _v2). In general, the step number in the file name already implies the sequence, but an additional minor version can be used for rework on the same step.
	•	Another approach: incorporate the version into the main file name as you go. For instance, after step 2, you might consider that the document covering steps 1-2 is “Version 1” of the full risk assessment for that process. So name it P123_CustomerOnboarding_V1_Steps1-2.docx (as an example given). After step 4, that could be updated to ..._V2_Steps1-4.docx, and final after step 6 as ..._V3_Steps1-6.docx. This method yields fewer files (basically one combined document at a few key milestones), but it requires merging content. Choose one versioning scheme and apply it consistently team-wide to avoid mix-ups. The simpler approach is one file per step (no explicit version in name, since the step number acts as version), which we have outlined, but ensure everyone understands the approach.
	•	Utilize SharePoint’s version history feature as an additional safety net. Even if file names change at each step, SharePoint can keep prior versions of the same file if you choose to overwrite instead. In our recommended approach we aren’t overwriting but saving new files, so the version history might not be directly used, but it’s good to be aware of.
	•	Template and Style Resources: Provide the team with a Word template or style guide that matches the formatting rules. For example, a blank Word document with the correct Heading 2 style preset, table style preset, etc., can be stored in the global folder. While the Copilot agents will be formatting the content, having a reference template helps when users need to manually adjust or if they create any introductory material themselves. It also reinforces the look-and-feel expected.
	•	Quality Control and Reviews: At scale, consistency in content (not just formatting) is also important:
	•	Consider periodic peer reviews, especially for the more subjective outputs like risk statements and control gap analysis. Another risk SME can briefly review the Risk Consolidation (Step 4) output for one process while the original author moves to the next process. This can catch any major issues (like a missing major risk) early.
	•	Keep the CPS 230 guidelines and risk taxonomy handy (hence in the global folder). Encourage agents/users to reference them. For instance, when categorizing risks (operational, technological, etc.), the team should use the categories defined in the Risk Taxonomy document to ensure consistency in terminology across all processes. The system prompts can even be fed a summary of those categories so the AI uses consistent category names.
	•	Audit Trail and Records: Because CPS 230 is a compliance exercise, maintain an audit trail:
	•	The sequence of saved files, the central tracker, and SharePoint metadata collectively serve as an audit trail of the assessment process. Make sure these are backed up or not accidentally deleted. It’s wise to set the SharePoint library to require checkout and/or limit deletion rights during the project, so files aren’t lost.
	•	If feasible, have an audit log document or register where for each process, you record key notes or decisions (e.g., “Decided to combine two similar risks into one during Step 4”, or “Step 5 identified no controls for Risk R3 – flagged to Operational Risk team”). This kind of commentary can be invaluable later if regulators or internal audit ask how you arrived at certain outcomes. Such a log could be a column in the tracker or a separate file per process.
	•	Communication and Change Management: With a large team, hold a brief kickoff to walk through this plan. Ensure everyone understands how to use the Copilot Studio agents and these protocols. Encourage open communication if someone finds a better way to handle the chain or if any agent output consistently needs tweaking (that might indicate the prompt needs refinement for all).
	•	It might help to designate a “Copilot Process Lead” who monitors the overall progress and troubleshoots issues with the AI agents or documents. For example, if Agent 2 is producing tables with a formatting glitch, the lead can adjust the prompt for all users.
	•	Regular check-ins (weekly or even daily stand-ups if the timeline is tight) can keep the team aligned and allow sharing of tips.
	•	Efficiency and Minimizing Rework: To reduce manual rework:
	•	Leverage the AI to the fullest by providing it with all relevant inputs. For example, give the Process Detail agent (Step 2) not just the raw process doc but also any existing procedure maps or diagrams if available. Richer input can yield better output, requiring fewer manual fixes.
	•	If an output isn’t satisfactory, it’s often faster to refine the prompt and re-run the agent than to edit extensively by hand. Encourage users to iterate with the Copilot (e.g., “Regenerate with more detail on X”) within reason, rather than settling for a subpar result that must be overhauled manually. The checklist’s review step is a chance to decide if a rerun is needed.
	•	However, also guard against perfectionism—remember the purpose of these documents is to facilitate workshops and compliance discussions. They should be high quality, but the team doesn’t need to spend excessive time making them “pretty” beyond the agreed standards. The focus should remain on accuracy and completeness of content.

By implementing these best practices, the organization can efficiently manage a large-scale CPS 230 risk assessment initiative. The combination of a clear structure, defined roles for each AI agent, disciplined document handling, and team coordination will lead to consistent and auditable outputs for all business processes under review. This approach not only helps in meeting the CPS 230 regulatory requirements but also instills a repeatable workflow for future risk assessment exercises.
