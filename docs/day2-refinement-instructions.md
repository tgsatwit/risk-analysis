# Memo: Copilot Agent Structure and Process Refinements

Hi Tim,

I've been reviewing our approach with the 6 Copilot agents, and while the overall structure works well, I have some thoughts on how we might refine it for better outcomes.

## Agent Structure Options

I like the idea of potentially consolidating our instructions into a single agent with a comprehensive reference document, provided we can create clear prompts that direct it to the appropriate section of instructions. This could reduce setup complexity while maintaining the step-by-step progression. The key would be ensuring the agent can properly navigate the document based on specific prompts.

## Process Flow Refinements

### Process Analysis (Agents 1 & 2)
I suggest we flip the sequencing here:
1. Start with the **detailed process breakdown** (limited to 10 steps) in tabular format
2. Then request the executive summary based on that detailed analysis

This creates a more logical flow where the summary is derived from the detailed analysis rather than created in parallel.

### Process Control Identification
Before moving to failure analysis, we should add an early step to:
- Extract a standalone list of key tools, templates, and potential controls identified in the process
- Note where in the process each control appears
- Create a reference list of these control activities that we can use later in the analysis

This gives us an early view of the control environment directly from the process documentation before we start thinking about failure points and risks.

### Failure Point Analysis
The current approach of mapping failures to each process step is creating significant repetition. Instead, I suggest:
1. Identify common failure types that could occur across multiple process steps
2. Group these by failure category (e.g., timeliness issues, accuracy problems, system failures)
3. Then map where in the process these common failure types are most likely to occur

This would avoid the repetitive identification of similar failures across different process steps.

### Risk Consolidation Refinements

While the current risk consolidation approach produces reasonable results, I've identified opportunities to improve quality and completeness through targeted follow-up questions:

#### Key Follow-Up Questions to Improve Risk Quality

After the initial risk consolidation, we should sequence these additional questions:

1. **Eliminate Redundancy:**
- "Review these consolidated risks and identify any that are substantially similar or overlapping in cause and impact. How might these be further consolidated?"
- "Which risks should be combined based on similar outcomes rather than similar causes?"

2. **Materiality Assessment:**
- "Which of these risks would be considered material from an organizational perspective, and which are lower priority?"
- "Are there risks that primarily affect the customer rather than the organization (e.g., customer's failure to submit information on time)? How should these be characterized differently?"

3. **CPS 230 Resilience Alignment:**
- "Considering CPS 230 requirements for operational resilience, are there specific resilience risks that should be explicitly articulated for this process?"
- "Does this process have clear business continuity risks documented? If not, how should they be articulated?"
- "Are there IT recovery risks identified given the systems involved in this process?"
- "Does this process rely on material third-party or service providers? What specific risks does this introduce?"

4. **Risk Register Mapping:**
- "Compare these risks to the existing risk register extract. For each consolidated risk, indicate whether it is fully, partially, or not covered by existing documented risks." (Note: Don't force matches where they don't exist)
- "Are there relevant risks in the existing register that aren't represented in our consolidated risk list? What additional risks should we consider based on the organization's existing risk documentation?"

This iterative approach would help ensure we capture all relevant CPS 230 resilience requirements and align with the organization's risk framework.

### Quality Check Integration

We should build in quality validation steps throughout the process. After each major output, include a prompt like:
- "Play devil's advocate: What are the top 5 things that might be missing from this analysis?"
- "What perspectives or considerations might have been overlooked in this assessment?"
- "Where would a risk or control professional likely challenge these conclusions?"

This self-challenge mechanism will help identify blind spots before moving to the next step and improve the overall quality of our outputs.

### Control Analysis Approach

I propose we significantly revise the control analysis approach. Rather than starting with "expected" controls (which led to excessive repetition), we should use this sequence:

1. **Existing Control Mapping**
- Upload the existing control register from Archer
- For each risk we've identified, systematically identify which existing controls mitigate it
- Perform an exhaustive line-by-line comparison, not stopping after finding one match
- Create a clear mapping table of risks and their corresponding existing controls

2. **Separate Non-Relevant Controls**
- Create a separate table listing controls deemed not relevant to our identified risks
- Include a follow-up prompt: "Are there any controls in this 'non-relevant' list that should actually be considered relevant? If so, which ones and why?"

3. **Process Documentation Control Identification**
- Return to our early-stage process control identification output
- Compare these identified process controls against the Archer controls
- Identify controls that appear in the process but aren't documented in Archer
- Create a list of "undocumented controls" that should be considered for addition to Archer

4. **Gap Analysis**
- Taking a holistic view of all identified risks and matched controls, identify control gaps
- Categorize gaps by control type (preventative vs. detective) and implementation (manual vs. automated)
- Ask: "For each risk, do we have an appropriate balance of preventative and detective controls?"
- Ask: "Where could automation improve control effectiveness in this process?"
- Ask: "What system controls might be missing from this analysis?"

5. **Final Control Classification**
- Produce a final output that categorizes all controls into four buckets:
a) Controls in Archer that are relevant to identified risks
b) Controls in Archer that appear not relevant to identified risks
c) Controls identified in the process documentation but not documented in Archer
d) Control gaps - where further work is needed to identify or implement controls

This approach ensures we build a comprehensive view of the control environment while avoiding forced matching or excessive repetition.

## Benefits of This Approach

This refined approach should:
1. Create more meaningful, consolidated risks that align with CPS 230 requirements
2. Reduce repetition in both failure points and risks
3. Provide a more holistic view of the control environment
4. Better connect failure points to broader risk themes
5. Create more actionable insights for the validation workshops
6. Ensure completeness against regulatory requirements
7. Identify genuine control gaps rather than theoretical gaps

## Implementation Suggestion

Rather than creating entirely new agents, I recommend an iterative approach within our existing structure:
1. Keep the current agent structure but add sequenced follow-up prompts after initial outputs
2. Store intermediate outputs and feed them back into subsequent refinement questions
3. Focus on building quality through iteration rather than trying to get perfect results in one pass
