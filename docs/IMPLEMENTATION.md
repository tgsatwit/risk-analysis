# CPS 230 Risk Assessment Copilot Implementation

## Project Overview

This repository contains all files needed to implement a custom Microsoft Copilot Studio agent for CPS 230 risk assessment in an Australian superannuation company. The agent assists risk and compliance teams in analyzing business process documentation using a structured 6-step methodology aligned with APRA CPS 230 requirements.

## Repository Contents

### Core Configuration Files

- **[system-prompt.md](system-prompt.md)** - The base instructions for the Copilot agent that define its behavior, expertise, and structured approach.
- **[starter-prompts.md](starter-prompts.md)** - Suggested conversation starters and greeting message for the agent.
- **[copilot-deployment-guide.md](copilot-deployment-guide.md)** - Step-by-step instructions for setting up and deploying the agent in Microsoft Copilot Studio.

### Templates and Reference Documents

- **[cps230-process-analysis-template.md](cps230-process-analysis-template.md)** - The output template that the agent's responses will align with.
- **[aus-super-rm-template.md](aus-super-rm-template.md)** - Risk taxonomy document defining risk categories for the organization.
- **[operational-risk-controls-framework.md](operational-risk-controls-framework.md)** - Framework of standard controls for different risk types to guide recommendations.
- **[CPS230-workshop-preparation-instructions.md](CPS230-workshop-preparation-instructions.md)** - The 6-step methodology for risk assessment workshops.

### User Documentation

- **[user-guide.md](user-guide.md)** - Comprehensive guide for end users on how to effectively use the Copilot agent.
- **[sample-process-member-onboarding.md](sample-process-member-onboarding.md)** - A sample process document for testing the agent's capabilities.

### Background Documents

- **[complete-instructions.md](complete-instructions.md)** - Detailed implementation plan that explains the design and configuration.
- **[controls-framework.md](controls-framework.md)** - Original controls framework document for reference.
- **[required-output.md](required-output.md)** - Basic template structure requirements.

## Implementation Steps

To implement the CPS 230 Risk Assessment Copilot:

1. **Prepare SharePoint Environment:**
   - Create a dedicated SharePoint site for hosting process documentation and reference materials
   - Upload all process PDFs (approximately 50 documents) to a dedicated document library
   - Upload the reference documents (risk taxonomy, controls framework, etc.) to the site

2. **Set Up Copilot Studio Agent:**
   - Follow the detailed instructions in [copilot-deployment-guide.md](copilot-deployment-guide.md)
   - Configure the agent with the system prompt, knowledge sources, and starter prompts
   - Test with sample process documents before full deployment

3. **Roll Out to Users:**
   - Share the [user-guide.md](user-guide.md) with the risk and compliance team
   - Consider conducting training sessions on effective use of the agent
   - Establish a feedback mechanism for continuous improvement

## The 6-Step Risk Assessment Process

The Copilot agent is designed to guide users through a structured analysis:

1. **Process Summary:** Provide an executive summary of the process documentation
2. **Process Details Table:** Extract key process steps, roles, systems, and other components
3. **Failure Point Analysis:** Identify what could go wrong at each step of the process
4. **Risk Consolidation:** Consolidate failure points into a formal risk register with categorization
5. **Expected Controls:** Recommend appropriate controls for each identified risk
6. **Gap Analysis:** Compare expected controls to what's documented in the process

## Usage Example

A typical workflow with the Copilot would be:

1. The user shares a process document with the agent
2. The agent produces a process summary and details table
3. The user requests failure point analysis
4. The agent identifies potential failures for each process step
5. The user asks for risk consolidation
6. The agent creates a formal risk register with categorized risks
7. The user requests control recommendations
8. The agent suggests appropriate controls for each risk
9. The user asks for gap analysis
10. The agent compares expected controls to the documentation and identifies gaps

The outputs align with the CPS 230 Process Analysis Template, making it easy to incorporate them into final documentation.

## Maintenance and Governance

The Copilot agent should be maintained as a living system:

- **Regular Updates:** Review and update reference materials as risk frameworks or regulatory requirements change
- **Knowledge Base Maintenance:** Keep the process documentation library current
- **Feedback Loop:** Collect user feedback and refine the agent's prompts and knowledge
- **Version Control:** Document changes to the agent in a change log
- **Compliance Oversight:** Ensure the agent's operations align with organizational AI governance

## Technical Requirements

- Microsoft Copilot Studio license
- Microsoft 365 environment with SharePoint
- Microsoft Teams (for optimal deployment)
- Appropriate permissions to access process documentation
