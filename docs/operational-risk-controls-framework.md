# Operational Risk Controls Framework

This framework supports the Risk Management Framework across the Group. It outlines standard controls expected for common operational risks in an Australian superannuation company.

## Control Types and Categories

### Control Types
- **Preventative Controls:** Designed to prevent a risk event from occurring. (Example: Segregation of duties, system validations)
- **Detective Controls:** Designed to detect a risk event that has occurred. (Example: Reconciliations, exception reports)
- **Corrective Controls:** Designed to correct or mitigate the impact of a risk event. (Example: Business continuity plans, data recovery procedures)

### Control Categories
- **Manual Controls:** Performed entirely by people without system assistance. (Example: Manual reviews, physical asset counts)
- **Automated Controls:** Performed entirely by systems with no human intervention. (Example: System validations, automated alerts)
- **Semi-automated Controls:** Combination of system and human actions. (Example: Exception reports requiring review, system-generated reconciliations requiring approval)

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing controls:
1. Consider the risk profile of the process (criticality, complexity, etc.)
2. Balance control effectiveness with operational efficiency
3. Ensure controls are proportionate to the risk
4. Consider control interdependencies
5. Document control design and operation
6. Regularly test control effectiveness

## Control Selection Criteria

Controls should be selected based on:
- Alignment with risk type and severity
- Cost-effectiveness
- Integration with existing processes and systems
- Regulatory requirements
- Industry best practices

## Control Implementation and Monitoring

For all implemented controls:
- Clearly define control objectives
- Assign control ownership
- Document control operation procedures
- Establish control testing frequency and methodology
- Define control performance metrics
- Report on control effectiveness

This framework serves as a guide for identifying appropriate controls during the CPS 230 risk assessment process. Controls should be tailored to the specific context and requirements of each business process.
